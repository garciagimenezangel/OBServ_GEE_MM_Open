# OBServ_Models_Open

This repository contains the implementation of two types of pollination supply models[1]:

The folder **Lonsdorf** contains the implementation of the Lonsdorf model[2] in Google Earth Engine.

The folder **Machine Learning** contains the implementation of a machine learning pipeline to predict pollinator visitation rate, using scikit-learn in Python.

# Pipeline for Lonsdorf scores (in preparation)

# Pipeline for machine learning predictions (in preparation)
