Origin of the tables:
- FloralNest-CORINE_SpainAssessment.csv: assessment by Ainhoa, Nacho and Curro
- FloralNest-CORINE_ESTIMAP: Zulian et al. 2013
- FloralNest-CGLS_ESTIMAP.csv: adaptation by Angel of FloralNest-CORINE_ESTIMAP.csv, to the CGLS discrete classification system. Next, CGLS class -> "most" equivalent CORINE. Scores computed as the average
	- 20: Shrubs -> 322, 323, 324
	- 30: Herbaceous vegetation -> 321
	- 40: Cultivated and managed vegetation / agriculture -> 211,212,213
	- 50: Urban / built up -> 111, 112, 121, 122, 123, 124, 131, 132, 133, 141, 142
	- 60: Bare / sparse vegetation -> 331, 333
	- 70: Snow and ice -> 335
	- 80: Permanent water bodies -> 511, 512
	- 90: Herbaceous wetland -> 411, 412, 421
	- 100: Moss and lichen -> 322
	- 111: Closed forest, evergreen needle leaf -> 312
	- 112: Closed forest, evergreen broad leaf -> 311
	- 113: Closed forest, deciduous needle leaf -> 312
	- 114: Closed forest, deciduous broad leaf -> 311
	- 115: Closed forest, mixed -> 313
	- 116: Closed forest, not matching any of the other definitions -> 311, 312, 313
	- 121: Open forest, evergreen needle leaf -> 312
	- 122: Open forest, evergreen broad leaf -> 311
	- 123: Open forest, deciduous needle leaf -> 312
	- 124: Open forest, deciduous broad leaf -> 311
	- 125: Open forest, mixed -> 313
	- 126: Open forest, not matching any of the other definitions -> 311, 312, 313
	- 200: Oceans, seas -> 522, 523
	- Management nesting and floral: the CORINE classes mentioned above don't have a bonus assigned for management in Zulian et al. 2013. 
	However, I assign a 0.1 to cultivated and forest LC types, in order to have some effect from possible land pollinators-friendly management.

- FloralNest-CGLSCont_DelphiResults.csv: 
	- bare: from class 333 (sparse veg) in FloralNest-CORINE_SpainAssessment (class missing in DelphiResults)
	- crop: floral from DelphiResults, nesting from SpAssessm from classes 211,212.
	- grass: floral from DelphiResults, nesting and management from SpAssessm from classes 321,322,323. 
	- moss: from class 322 in SpAssessm (probably not correct (and probably not very important), election motivated because moss is included in that corine lc code (https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/Nomenclature.pdf))
	- shrub: floral from DelphiResults, nesting and management from SpAssessm from class 324.
	- tree: floral from DelphiResults, nesting and management from SpAssessm from classes 311,312,313.
	- urban: average from classes 1*(111-142) in SpAssessm, rounding in intervals of 0.05.
	- snow and water: all zeros
- FloralNest-CGLSCont_DelphiResults_Simplified.csv: simplification from FloralNest-CGLSCont_DelphiResults.csv. 
	- Nesting cavity igual. 
	- Nesting ground-wood from the three columns nesting ground, wood, stem. Every row equal for those columns except for urban. Taken intermediate value between ground and wood.
	- Removed floral summer, autumn and winter. Take spring (maximum values) as reference. This is motivated by the fact that the model will be confronted to abundances probably registered during a period of high pollinators' activity.
